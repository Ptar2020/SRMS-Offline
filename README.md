Hello.<br>
If you're reading this, it means you've reached the README.md to my second project as a programmer.<br>
It is one of the projects that I built as I was getting to know about Python, and programming in general. <br>
I thought, and was advised, that the best way to learn is by doing.<br>
So, I decided to practice that.<br>
Since my profession was a high school teacher, and was always doing exams analysis for my students, I decided to make a system to help in doing this.<br>
So, I tried to emulate the system that I was using at school.<br>
I did so much and during this period I learnt alot.<br>
Thought he system may not work perfectly, I believe it achieved it's purpose in me.<br>

This is a pure Python Project.
PyQt helped in designing the GUI<br>
Thank you.
